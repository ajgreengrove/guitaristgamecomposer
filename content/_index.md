I compose game music, but with "coder / gamedev" twists:

-   I script scores in [LilyPond](https://lilypond.org/)
-   I code instruments in [Csound](https://csound.com/)
-   while composing, I rescore games with fx audio to ensure quality

A few "bonuses":

-   I play game guitar covers, and
-   decrypt music theory behind the game music.
