Now the clarifying story in more natural language.
I have a classical background and love early music,
so over time I'll delve deeper into a genre combination of
progressive rock sound with baroque &amp; game music influence.

The John Dowland reference is a joke about
the command line which I literally live in,
and Henry Purcell's Abdelaizer was used in Thunder Castle (1986).

And then for the more PITA part: I started as [A J Greengrove](https://www.ajgreengrove.com/),
but after having to learn about business, marketing etc,
realized that people just wanted A J Greengrove to play guitar,
not to do all this game stuff. One brand name = one avatar (audience).
Thus ~$ GgC, "coding gamedev composer", was born.
